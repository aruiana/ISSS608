This is also persistent in most planning areas with the exception of Jurong West and Woodlands. This maybe because of the labour intensive job opportunities in that area which cause more males to move to that area.\n\n\n\nWe observed that in the following planning areas, there is a sharp dip in the population aged 40 - 49. The population for 50 then increases before it dips down again at 60.\n\nBukit Batok\nChua Chu Kang\nHougang\nTampines\nYishun\nWoodlands (Males only)\n\n\n\n\nFor all top 9 planning areas, there are more females than males aged 89 and above. This is inline with research (https://www.prb.org/resources/around-the-globe-women-outlive-men/) that women have a longer life expectancy than men.\n\n\n\nThe planning areas Hougang and Yishun has the average population closest to the average line and thus would be an optimal area to do a population survey using these areas as statistical representation."
